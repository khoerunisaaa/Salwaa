# 🖼️ CIFAR-10 Image Classification  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project implements **image classification** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.  
The dataset consists of **60,000 32x32 color images** across **10 categories** such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.  

The main objective is to build and train a CNN model that can classify unseen images with high accuracy.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3** – main programming language.  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – deep learning framework for building and training CNN.  
- **Matplotlib** – visualization of accuracy and loss.  
- **NumPy & Pandas** – data manipulation and preprocessing.  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** – development environment with GPU acceleration.  

## 📊 Model Highlights  
- CNN architecture with multiple **Conv2D**, **MaxPooling**, **Dropout**, and **Dense** layers.  
- Trained using **categorical crossentropy loss** and **Adam optimizer**.  
- Achieves training and validation accuracy improvement across epochs.  
- Final accuracy reaches **~70–80%** depending on hyperparameters.
